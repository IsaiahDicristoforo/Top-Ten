# Top-Ten Mobile App Group Project

## Introduction
Top Ten is an engaging Android polling app in which users can vote on a list of items, ultimately forming a “definitive” top ten ranking for the items. Users can rank their favorite fast-food restaurants, movies, albums, and much more. 

* Each day, a new list items is released, sparking debate among users as they advocate for their favorite items. 
* Users will receive a notification each morning as the list of the day is about to be released.
* Before voting begins, users can predict which item will come out on top, earning points if guessing correctly.

## Storyboard
